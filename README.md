<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>It's a multi-step survey which can be added to a website by including a short snippet of code. The code will load a pop-up containing the survey.</p>
<ul>
  <li>It's a dead-simple way to get feedback from the users</li>
  <li>Contains basic css styles from external css stylesheet: http://getskeleton.com</li>
  <li>No third party JS tools!</li>
  <li>No jQuery required, just plain javascript!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Setting up is pretty straight-forward:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Include the stylesheet in the head tag.</li>
  <li>Add js file before closing <body> tag.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The survey pop-up loads 2 seconds after the page has loaded.</li>
  <li>It contains steps and have NEXT and PREVIOUS buttons on pages which need them. </li>
  <li>It contains the following fields (2 fields per step): 
    <ul>
      <li>Step 1: Name (input), Email (input)</li>
      <li>Step 2: Age (select), About me (textarea)</li>
      <li>Step 3: Address (input), Gender (input[radio])</li>
      <li>Step 4: Favourite Book (input), Favourite Colors (input[checkbox])</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All fields on the first 2 steps are required. All fields on the final 2 steps are optional.</li>
  <li>Once all steps have been completed, the pop-up displays a table with all of the data collected in the survey.</li>
  <li>If the browser is closed and re-opened, the script opens the survey on the right step.</li>
